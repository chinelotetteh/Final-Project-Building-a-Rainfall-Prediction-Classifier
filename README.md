**Project Name:** Building a Rainfall Prediction Classifier
 
This project focuses on building a machine learning classifier to predict the likelihood of rainfall based on historical weather data. Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness.

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on building a robust machine-learning model (classifier) that predicts whether it will rain the following day using weather-related features and based on historical weather data. Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness.
This project involves data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

**Key Objectives:**

- Collect and explore historical weather data.

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

- Implement and evaluate multiple machine learning classifiers.

- Optimize the model for better accuracy and generalization.

**Dataset:** The dataset used in this project contains weather-related attributes including: Date and location, temperature (Max, Min, Average), humidity levels, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, rainfall amount, target variable: "RainTomorrow" (Yes/No).

**Tools and Libraries:**

Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data visualization)

Scikit-learn (Machine learning models)

Jupyter Notebook (Interactive analysis)

**Methodology:**

- Data Collection: Utilize publicly available weather datasets.

- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze patterns and relationships between features and target.

- Model Development: Implement and compare classifiers such as: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest.

- Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score and ROC-AUC Curve

- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.

**Results:**

- Implemented multiple classifiers to predict rainfall with varying accuracy.

- Identified key features influencing rainfall predictions.

- Improved model performance through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

**Future Work:**

- Explore advanced models like XGBoost and Neural Networks.

- Incorporate additional weather features (e.g seasonal trends).

- Deploy the model as a web-based rainfall prediction application.
